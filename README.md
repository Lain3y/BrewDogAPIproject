# BrewDog API Project

This Python project leverages the BrewDog API to help you choose a delightful combination of bar snacks and BrewDog beers. Originally developed for a [Code First Girls](www.codefirstgirls.com) degree project, this application has been updated for improved human readability. Please note that it is still a work in progress.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed in PyCharm:
- `requests`
- `random`

You can install these packages using the following commands:
```bash
pip install requests
pip install random
```

## Usage
1. Run the script in your Python environment.
2. Follow the prompts to choose between savoury and sweet snacks.
3. Explore the daily menu options for your selected category.
4. Press Enter to reveal the perfect beer pairing.

## Functionality
### Text Wrapping
To enhance readability, a `wrap_text` function is implemented. This function ensures that beer descriptions are displayed in a user-friendly format without appearing as one long line.

### Savoury Snack Pairing
If you choose a savoury snack, the script displays a menu and randomly selects a BrewDog beer that pairs well with the chosen snack category.

### Sweet Snack Pairing
If you opt for a sweet snack, the script showcases a sweet menu and randomly selects a BrewDog beer that complements the selected sweet treat.

## Important Note
This project is still under development, and improvements are ongoing. Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to enhance its functionality and user experience.
